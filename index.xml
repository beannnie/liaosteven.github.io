      <description>Font My preferred font (and my favorite font in general) for viewing this site: brown by aurele sacks
But, you probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need me to tell you that, if you&amp;rsquo;re seeing it ;).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have brown installed on your machine (and you probably don&amp;rsquo;t if you&amp;rsquo;re not sure) you&amp;rsquo;re probably viewing this site through open sans or bree serif
Artwork Thanks to the talented jennifer zhu for commissioning my self-portraits</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Steven - thanks for visiting my site :).
I use this site primarily to share projects I do related to sports analytics. I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with sports analytics since college, where I was a member of the Brown Sports Analytics Club.
Outside of sports, interests and hobbies of mine include design, optimizing / quantifying / modeling everyday decisions, learning about how things work, and recently, hiking and learning new languages (to improve cultural immersion and exchange, when I travel).</description>
