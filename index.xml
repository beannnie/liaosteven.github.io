      <description>Font My preferred font (and my favorite font in general) for viewing this site: Brown by Aurele Sacks.
But, you probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need me to tell you that, if you&amp;rsquo;re seeing it ;).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have Brown installed on your machine (and you probably don&amp;rsquo;t if you&amp;rsquo;re not sure) you&amp;rsquo;re probably viewing this site through Open Sans or Bree Serif.

      <description>Hey there - I&amp;rsquo;m Steven - thanks for visiting my site :).
This site is for me to post my random musings and projects related to sports analytics. It&amp;rsquo;s not intended to be overly academic or technical, content-restrained, nor will I plan to do any heavy editoralizing. I like to think of the content as glorified reddit posts, where I strive to follow a particular nugget of advice from Youtubers everywhere, &amp;lsquo;Create Content you would like to see&amp;rsquo;.</description>
