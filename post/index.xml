      <description>TLDR: The final score does not tell the whole story regarding how close a game was. Integrated Point Differential (IPD) improves upon Point Differential by accounting for the score throughout the game, as opposed to just the final score. Spread Integrated Point Differential (SIPD) adjusts IPD with respect to the spread, and could be a useful proxy for whether a bet was the right side (even if it didn&amp;rsquo;t cover).</description>

      <description>In my content, I may frequently reference sports betting terminology / ideas. Under the dry not wet principle, I am writing this guide.
A betting line offered by sportsbooks is almost always presented as:
[Team] [Spread] [Odds] 
 The team is the team you&amp;rsquo;re betting on in a given match. The spread is a &amp;lsquo;handicap&amp;rsquo; - (see the example below). The odds tell you how much money you&amp;rsquo;ll receive, if you win the bet.</description>

      <title>valuing nfl draft picks</title>

      <description>TLDR: We make a model valuing draft picks according to how much they outperform their rookie contract (using historical data from 1994-2016). Draft picks tend to be underpaid on the whole (as expected), serving as cheap talent (whereas free agents are &amp;lsquo;properly priced talent&amp;rsquo;). The most underpaid draft picks are in the late first round and early second round; counterintuitively, this suggests they could actually be worth more than high first round picks.</description>
