      <description>What is the best way to measure how close a game is?
As a recreational sports better, this question is clearly of interest. Consider:
 If two teams are 8-0, and one has been winning in blowouts, but the other has been winning in close games, perhaps the &amp;lsquo;blowout&amp;rsquo;-winning team is the better squad.
 If team A is playing team B for the second time this year, perhaps it would be interesting to know how close things were the first time around.</description>

      <description>In my content, I may frequently reference sports betting terminology / ideas. Under the dry not wet principle, I am writing this guide.
A betting line offered by sportsbooks is almost always presented as:
[Team] [Spread] [Odds] 
 The team is the team you&amp;rsquo;re betting on in a given match. The spread is a &amp;lsquo;handicap&amp;rsquo; - (see the example below). The odds tell you how much money you&amp;rsquo;ll receive, if you win the bet.</description>

      <title>valuing nfl draft picks</title>
      <link>https://stevenliao.me/post/draft_pick_valuation/</link>

      <description>TLDR: We make a model valuing draft picks according to how much they outperform their rookie contract (using historical data from 1994-2016). Draft picks tend to be underpaid on the whole (as expected), serving as cheap talent (whereas free agents are &amp;lsquo;properly priced talent&amp;rsquo;). The most underpaid draft picks are in the late first round and early second round; counterintuitively, this suggests they could actually be worth more than high first round picks.</description>
